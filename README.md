# Operation Moar Bknd

I love [Bknd](https://bknd.io/), but I'm often perplexed on why it's not more widely adopted. 

I think the main culprits are awareness and education.

That's why I'm taking it upon myself to create some docs in hopes that it helps someone, because I know it's going to help me.
