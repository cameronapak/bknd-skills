# WIP: Supplemental Bknd Docs

**I love [Bknd](https://bknd.io/), but I'm often perplexed on why it's not more widely adopted**. I think the main culprits are awareness and education.

> It doesn't matter how good your product is, because if its documentation is not good enough, people will not use it. Even if they have to use it because they have no choice, without good documentation, they won't use it effectively or the way you'd like them to.

That's why I'm taking it upon myself to create some docs in hopes that it helps someone, because I know it's going to help me.

> [!NOTE]
> > I'm no expert. However, I am a student who loves to learn and to help unlock others. 

> [!WARNING]
> Almost all of the docs are AI generated. 
> I have used MCP tools like Zread and Grep.app to make sure I'm referencing the most up-to-date code for Bknd.
> I am also using tools like `opensrc` to locally pull in the Bknd repo and grep against that. 
> All plans were created through me riffing back and forth with AI.
> My buddy [Ralph Wiggum](https://x.com/ryancarson/status/2008548371712135632) has written most of the code.
> For now, consider all of this to be a work in progress.
