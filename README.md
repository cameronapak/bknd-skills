# Bknd Skills

**I love [Bknd](https://bknd.io/), but I'm often perplexed on why it's not more widely adopted**. I think the main culprits are awareness and education.

I'm going to create [skills](https://agentskills.io) that make it easier to develop with Bknd.

## Get Started

Easiest and best way to get started is through using Vercel's `[add-skill](https://github.com/vercel-labs/add-skill)` package. 

```bash
# Local repo installation
npx add-skill cameronapak/bknd-expert

# Install to specific agents
npx add-skill cameronapak/bknd-expert -a cursor -a claude-code

# Global installation
npx add-skill cameronapak/bknd-expert -g
```

## Attribution

I've gained a lot of inspiration for these Bknd skills from [encoredev/skills](https://github.com/encoredev/skills/tree/main)
